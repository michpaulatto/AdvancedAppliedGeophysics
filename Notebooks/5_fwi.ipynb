        "In this exercise we look at a 2D example of full waveform inversion. \n",
        "For our example we use synthetic data generated using a realistic layered velocity model. The Marmousi model was created in 1988 by the Institut Francais du PÃ©trole (IFP). The model is based on a real profile through the North Quenguela trough in the Kwanza basin (offshore Angola). The geometry and velocity model were created to produce complex seismic data which require advanced processing techniques to obtain an accurate Earth image. Traditional traveltime tomography is not suited to recover the detailed velocity information contained in the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Marmousi model has been used extensively for testing of new methods and approaches for Earth imaging, not restricted to waveform inversion.\n",
        "\n",
        "You will not be running the inversion in real time. This would be too time consuming and complex to set up for the whole class. Instead the inversion has been run in advance on Imperial College's HPC cluster. This took only a few minutes, using 2 nodes, each runnning 24 processes. Large 3D inversions can take several days to run and require hundreds of compute nodes.\n",
        "\n",
        "The waveform modelling and inversion is done using Fullwave3d, a code developed at Imperial College by the Fullwave group, led by Mike Warner (https://fullwave3d.github.io/). Here we analyse the output from the inversion. We will start by looking at the artificial \"field data\" and the true model and starting model. We will then look at the different steps required to invert the waveform data and produce a velocity model."
