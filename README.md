Computer exercises for Advanced Applied Geophysics teaching module

This repository contains a list of Jupyter notebooks with exercises associated with the Advanced Applied Geophysics class that I lead at Imperial College London. This collection will grow as I develop more material. If you try the exercises I would be happy to hear any comments you may have.

Reuse and modification are encouraged.
